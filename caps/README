The goal of this section is to create a .js file containing capacitor selections
for the inverter designer.

The table has been created by taking screenshots of the capacitor datasheets
from multiple capacitor manufacturers, then extracting the text using OCR.
The OCR can be somewhat noisy, so manually inspect and clean up the OCR output
to create an input file for the next step.  Each datasheet has a slightly
different format, so each folder has a separate script to convert their
specific format to the common entry used in the designer's cap_table.js file.

{
  mfg:      'CDE',
  pn:       '944U101K801AA',
  tech:     'Film',
  c:        100.0,
  v_dc:     800.0,
  i_rms:    74.0,
  esl:      20.0,
  esr:      0.0005,
  th_cc:    2.8,
  th_ca:    5.2,
  shape:    'cylinder',
  dim_dia:  84.5,
  dim_z:    40.0,
},

In the file, each entry is usually collapsed onto one line, to make the file more
readable by humans.

The shell script gen.sh combines all the individual capacitor tables, adds a prefix
and suffix to make the final cap_table.js file.

In the parent folder, the shell script mk_release.sh will copy caps/cap_table.js to
the designer folder if it has a newer modify time than designer/cap_table.js.
